Contributing Stubs
------------------
PHP Analyzer uses stubs for built-in PHP classes and functions. These stubs look like regular PHP code
and define the available parameters, their types, properties, methods etc. If you would like to contribute 
a fix or additional stubs, please fork and submit a patch to the legacy branch:
